# WinForms Scheduler - Optimize performance for large datasets

The WinForms Scheduler control behaves perfectly well when there is a reasonable amount of appointments to display. If there are too many appointments, the application fetches unnecessary data, increases system workload, and slows down the overall performance. This example demonstrates how to handle the [FetchAppointments](https://docs.devexpress.com/CoreLibraries/DevExpress.XtraScheduler.ISchedulerStorageBase.FetchAppointments)Â event to limit the number of appointments fetched from the data source.
